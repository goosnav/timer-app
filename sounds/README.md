# Alarm sounds

Place any custom alarm audio you want to use in this directory. Supported formats include WAV, MP3, OGG, FLAC, AAC, M4A, AIFF, and more. Files added here will automatically appear in the timer's alarm sound picker the next time the app is launched.

The app seeds this folder with a few default alarms the first time it runs, and any imported files are copied here so playback always uses the contents of this directory.
